Welcome to **Midnight Terminal**, a tense and cooperative survival game set in the abandoned *Hospitalet Station*. After a catastrophic nuclear disaster, you and your team are the last hope to restore order in a decaying train station filled with deadly mutants. Work together to repair the trains and reactivate the station, but beware—the irradiated creatures lurking in the shadows won't make it easy.

## 📜 **Overview**

In *Midnight Terminal*, you and your fellow technicians are dispatched to the desolate *Hospitalet Station*, once a thriving transportation hub. Following a nuclear incident, the area has become hostile and dangerous. Mutants roam the abandoned tracks, tunnels, and control rooms. Your mission is to repair the damaged trains and get them moving again while managing scarce resources and surviving mutant threats. 

## 🎮 **Game Features**

- 🤝 **Cooperative Multiplayer**: Team up with friends to face the dangers of *Hospitalet Station* together. Effective communication and coordination are essential for survival.
- 🛠️ **Repair Missions**: Restore and reactivate abandoned trains to open new areas, reestablish tracks, and pave the way for an escape.
- ⚙️ **Resource Management**: Balance the use of limited tools, weapons, and energy. Choose whether to light up hallways or activate temporary defense systems. (WIP)
- 🧟 **Dynamic Mutant AI**: Mutants behave unpredictably due to radiation exposure—some are blind and hunt by sound, while others are fast or block key paths. (WIP)
- ⚡ **Constant Tension**: Random events, like power outages or unexpected noise, increase the pressure and force players to adapt on the fly.
- 🔫 **Weapon Upgrades**: Purchase weapons throughout the game to improve your odds of survival. (WIP)

## 🎯 **Player Objectives**

Your primary objectives in *Midnight Terminal* are:

1. 🚂 **Repair the Trains**: Reactivate the engines to access new areas, reconnect tracks, and make the trains operational for evacuation.
2. 🧟‍♂️ **Survive the Mutants**: Hide, distract, or confront the mutated creatures as you work to complete repairs.
3. ⚙️ **Manage Resources**: Use your limited tools and weapons wisely. Station power is unreliable, so you'll need to decide whether to light dark corridors or activate defenses. (WIP)

## 🧟 **Mutants**

The mutants at *Hospitalet Station* are the result of heavy radiation exposure. Their behavior is erratic, and they pose a constant threat:

- 🧠 **Mutant Types**:
  - Some are **blind** and navigate by sound, requiring stealth.
  - Others are **extremely fast**, forcing you to move strategically.
  - A few can **block specific routes**, creating obstacles.
- ⏳ **Dynamic Threat**: The longer you stay in the station, the more mutants appear, escalating the difficulty and tension.

## ⚠️ **Tension Mechanics**

- 🤜🤛 **Cooperative Interactions**: Some tasks, like aligning train tracks or pushing trains, require teamwork and precise coordination.
- 🛠️ **Tough Choices**: Decide whether to use tools for immediate progress or save them for crucial moments later in the mission.

## 📋 **How to Play**

1. 👥 **Form a Team**: Join with friends or play solo with AI partners.
2. 🚉 **Explore the Station**: Identify damaged trains and plan repairs.
3. 🧰 **Gather and Manage Resources**: Tools, weapons, and power are limited—use them wisely.
4. 🛠️ **Complete Repair Tasks**: Fix trains, activate systems, and open new areas.
5. 🧟‍♂️ **Avoid or Confront Mutants**: Use stealth or fight back as needed, but remember—the longer you stay, the more dangerous it gets.

## 📖 **Lore**

After a catastrophic failure at the nearby nuclear power plant, *Hospitalet Station* was quarantined and abandoned. Radiation seeped into the environment, mutating both humans and animals into aggressive creatures. Amidst the chaos, many trains were left behind, unable to continue their journeys. Now, only specialized repair teams can reclaim the station, but the mutated remnants of the disaster won't go down without a fight.
