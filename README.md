Welcome to **Midnight Terminal**, a tense and cooperative survival game set in the abandoned *Hospitalet Station*. After a catastrophic nuclear disaster, you and your team are the last hope to restore order in a decaying train station filled with deadly mutants. Work together to repair the trains and reactivate the station, but beware—the irradiated creatures lurking in the shadows won't make it easy.

## 📜 **Overview**

In *Midnight Terminal*, you and your fellow technicians are dispatched to the desolate *Hospitalet Station*, once a thriving transportation hub. Following a nuclear incident, the area has become hostile and dangerous. Mutants roam the abandoned tracks, tunnels, and control rooms.

- 🛠️ **Repair Missions**: Restore and reactivate abandoned trains to open new areas, reestablish tracks, and pave the way for an escape.
- 🧟 **Dynamic Mutant AI**: Mutants behave unpredictably due to radiation exposure—some are blind and hunt by sound, while others are fast or block key paths.
- ⚡ **Constant Tension**: Random events, like power outages or unexpected noise, increase the pressure and force players to adapt on the fly.

## 📖 **Lore**

After a catastrophic failure at the nearby nuclear power plant, *Hospitalet Station* was quarantined and abandoned. Radiation seeped into the environment, mutating both humans and animals into aggressive creatures. Amidst the chaos, many trains were left behind, unable to continue their journeys. Now, only specialized repair teams can reclaim the station, but the mutated remnants of the disaster won't go down without a fight.

- 🏗️ **Alpha Version**: Core mechanics, and multiplayer gameplay.
- 🔧 **Beta Version**: Advanced AI and repair events.
- 🚀 **Full Release**: IA improvment and 3 player teams.
